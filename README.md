# Crime Prediction Project

This project is focused on predicting crime occurrences using machine learning models, specifically leveraging an XGBoost Regressor for time-series data analysis. The goal is to analyze historical crime data to forecast future crime incidents based on trends and patterns found in the data.

The project includes a Jupyter Notebook for data exploration, model training, and evaluation, as well as a Flask API to provide an interface for making predictions based on new data.

## Key Features

- **Time-Series Analysis**: The project processes crime data by aggregating it over time (e.g., by year and month) to identify patterns.
- **Machine Learning Model**: An XGBoost Regressor is used to predict future crime occurrences based on historical data.
- **Web Interface**: A Flask-based API allows users to input data and receive crime predictions, making the model accessible through a web application.
- **Comprehensive Notebook**: The Jupyter Notebook includes all steps from data preprocessing to model evaluation, making it easy to follow the entire workflow.
